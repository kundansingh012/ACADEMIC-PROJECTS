           - Start/End dates
           - Company associations
        2. Network Analysis:
           - Bipartite networks (directors-companies)
           - Centrality measures
           - Connected components
  ### Tools Being Used
        - NetworkX for graph analysis
        - Pandas for data manipulation
        - Matplotlib/Plotly for visualization
        - Seaborn for statistical visualization
  ### Key Analyses Performed
        1. Network Metrics:
           - Eigenvector centrality
           - Degree centrality
           - Betweenness centrality
        2. Temporal Analysis:
           - Director tenure lengths
           - Board turnover rates
           - Appointment patterns
        3. Director Demographics:
           - Age distribution
           - Compensation patterns
           - Software background distribution
  ### Code Improvements Made
        1. Consolidated imports
        2. Added data validation
        3. Improved graph creation efficiency
        4. Enhanced error handling for network calculations
### 2. International education costs across different:
        - Countries
        - Universities
        - Programs
        - Degree levels
  ### Dataset Content
        Main cost components being analyzed:
        - Tuition fees (USD)
        - Living costs
        - Rent costs
        - Visa fees
        - Insurance costs
        - Exchange rates
  ### Project Objectives
        1. Analyze cost variations across:
           - Different countries
           - Program levels
           - Universities
        2. Identify:
           - Most/least affordable study destinations
           - Cost clustering patterns
           - Total cost predictions
        3. Help students make informed decisions about:
           - Financial planning
           - Destination selection
           - Program choices
  ### Tools Being Used
        - Python with pandas and numpy
        - Visualization: matplotlib and seaborn
        - Machine learning: scikit-learn
        - Statistical analysis tool
        
### 3. Project is an assignment focusing on statistical analysis with emphasis on:
        1. Linear and logistic regression techniques
        2. Data visualization 
        3. Model evaluation
