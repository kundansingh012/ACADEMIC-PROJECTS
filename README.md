           - Company associations
        2. Network Analysis:
           - Bipartite networks (directors-companies)
           - Centrality measures
           - Connected components
           
### Highlights

## 2. Prediction of International Education Cost

### Overview
- Predicts the total cost of studying abroad for international students by analyzing tuition, rent, living costs, visa, and insurance expenses. Compares regression models, applies clustering, and visualizes affordability patterns.
- 
### Dataset Content
        Main cost components being analyzed:
        - Tuition fees (USD)
        - Living costs
        - Rent costs
        - Visa fees
        - Insurance costs
        - Exchange rates
        
### Key Steps
- Data Preparation â€“ Handle missing values, feature engineering (Living_Cost_Total, Rent_Total, Total_Cost), scaling
- Modeling â€“ Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree (tuned max_depth)
- Clustering â€“ KMeans on top cost drivers; affordability grouping
- Custom Tool â€“ University lookup for predicted cost and affordability cluster

### Project Objectives
        1. Analyze cost variations across:
           - Different countries
           - Program levels
           - Universities
        2. Identify:
           - Most/least affordable study destinations
           - Cost clustering patterns
           - Total cost predictions
        3. Help students make informed decisions about:
           - Financial planning
           - Destination selection
           - Program choices
          - Statistical modeling libraries

### Results
Model	RÂ² Score	RMSE ($)	MAE ($)
Linear Regression	1.0000	0.00	0.00
Polynomial Regression	1.0000	0.00	0.00
Decision Tree (Tuned)	0.9919	3,603.92	2,369.87

### Technologies
- Python 3.11+, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
