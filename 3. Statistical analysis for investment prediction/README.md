# Statistical Analysis for Investment Prediction

## Project Overview
This project conducts a statistical investigation to support investment prediction by combining distribution analysis with regression modeling. It includes data exploration, robust and classical regression techniques, and visualization of statistical behaviors to derive insight into financial patterns.

## Key Features
- Data ingestion and inspection
- Visualization of payroll/investment trends over time
- Detection and discussion of outliers
- Training, validation and testing of Linear Regression models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and robust alternatives (Huber regressor)
- Statistical distribution experiments (e.g., Central Limit Theorem demonstrations)
- Model evaluation using MAE & MSE and report accuracy for predictive insights
- Built a linear regression model on log transformed revenue data and predicted revenue
- Logistic regression for negative media coverage

## Dataset
The notebook loads and analyzes a CSV dataset (e.g., payroll/investment-related data).  
**Example file used:** `48849855_Cochran_LLC_PLC.csv`  
*(Update this section with the actual source, date retrieved, and any preprocessing steps applied.)*

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Core libraries (as inferred from the notebook):  
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
